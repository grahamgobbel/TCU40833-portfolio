            <h2>Reflection & Analysis</h2>
            
            <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
            <p>
                The data set I chose to use was extracted from a Kaggle dataset about e-commerce sales. 
                As a frequent Amazon shopper and someone interested in consumer behavior, I felt particulary 
                drawn to this data set. Thankfully  the data was already clean and only required a simple csv download
                to my laptop. I then uploaded the csv file to Tableau Public and was able to start creating visualizations right away.
            <h3>Design Choices</h3>
            <p>
                In Tableau, I created 5 different sheets including Total Revenue, Revenue by Category,
                Revenue by Region, Rating vs Revenue, and Trend (of revenue over time). I chose these categories becasue they are areas that I am genuinely curious 
                about and where I felt I could make assumptions. As for my design choices, I choose to keep things simple wih a clean white background, a consistent blue color scheme, 
                and a neat font. I used a couple of bar charts because I am most familiar with those and think it is a great way to compare different categories, and I used a 
                line graph for the trend over time because I think it is the best way to show changes over time. I also challenged myself by using a scatter plot for the rating vs revenue, 
                which I had not used before, and I think it turned out well and is a great way to show the relationship between those two variables.
                One dissapointment and challenge I encountered was that I was not able to create a map visualization with the data by Region
                , which is something I wanted to include in my dashboard. After some frustrating trial and error, I learned
                that a map was not possible because the data was formatted by continent rather than country, which is the 
                level of geographic detail Tableau requires for mapping. I could have manually edited the data and chosen to use the biggest 
                country in each respective continent to represent the region, but I knew that would be misleading and innacurate,
                so I decided to just use a bar chart instead to show the revenue by region. For the overall dashboard design,
                
            </p>

            <h3>Expected Patterns</h3>
            <p>
                I had a few initial thoughts before analyzing this data. First, I assumed that revenue would peak in December due to Christmas
                and the holiday season. My second assumption is that Home & Kitchen category would generate the most revenue. My thought process
                behind this is that items in this category are just past the convenience point of purchasing in store, and can also be bulky and more expensive,
                driving more people to buy online rather, especially on Amazon where they can get them almost as quickly as going to the store.
                Lastly, I expected that the North American region would generate the most revenue, as Amazon is based in the US and has a very
                strong presence here.</strong> 
            </p>

            <h3>Surprises/Outliers</h3>
            <p>
                Very surprisingly, I was incorrect about all of my initial assumptions. First, the data showed that the revenue actually peaked
                in summer months such as May and August, rather than December. I was surprised by this, but I think it could be explained by the fact 
                that people are more likely to shop online during the summer when they are busy and on the go, and also because of back to school shopping in August. 
                Nest, Home & Kitchen was third in Revenue by Category, with beauty products taking the lead. As someone who does not normally buy beauty products such as
                makeup and skincare online, I was surprised by this because I would have thought that people would want to see and try these products in person before buying.
                However, I think this could be explained by a few different factors. One explanation could be that customers are already familiar with the product they want
                and are not looking to try something new, so they are comfortable buying online, and might be getting a better deal by doing so.
                The last surprise was that the Middle East just barely edged out North America in Revenue by Region. I was really surprised by this because 
                I did not know that Amazon had such a strong presence there, but after doing a little bit of research I learned that Amazon has been rapidly 
                expanding in the Middle East and has become the largest e-commerce retailer in the region.
            <h3>Questions for Further Investigation</h3>
            <p>
                The following are some questions I have after analyzing the "surprises" in the data:
                <ul>
                    <li>What are the specific products that are driving the high revenue in the beauty category? Makeup? Skincare? Shower products?</li>
                    <li>What are the most frequently purchased items in the summer months?</li>
                    <li>What are the specific factors that are driving the high revenue in the Middle East region? How much of
                        that revenue is coming from specific countries?
                    <li>Does back-to-school shopping bring in more revenue than other seasonal events?</li>
                    <li>What products are bought frequently in other areas of the world that not bought in the US?</li>
                    </li>

            </p>
            <h3>Tool Evaluation</h3>
            <p>As a business student, I have for the most part enjoyed using Tableau for my work over the past 
                few years. I think it is great for beginners and for creating quick visualizations to get points across.
                I also like how you can make a visualization as simple or detailed as you want, and how you can easily connect to different
                data sources. Compared to Excel, which I also requently use, I think Tableau definitely makes better interactive visualizations and 
                gives the user more design flexbility. The dashboard feature is another one-up Tableau has on Excel, and it makes it very easy to drag, drop, and create 
                side by side visualizations. Although I have not encountered many issues with Tableau, I can think of a couple.
                Specifically in this project, I was frustrated by the fact that I could not create a map visualization with the data I had, 
                and I wish there was a way to work around that. Also, for beginners, and people like me who are coming back after not using it for a while,
                it can be a little bit overwhelming at first with all of the different options and features, and I think it could be helpful
                if there was a more guided way to learn the tool. However, with practice and exploration, I have found that Tableau is a very user-friendly
                 platform for data visualization, and I look forward to using it more in the future.
