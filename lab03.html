            <h3>Information Resolution</h3>
            <p>The visual I chose to analyze is called “Things Going Up! Up! Up!”. This graphic is actually six graphics in one and
                 showcases how things such as life expectancy, literacy, electricity access, and more have been increasing over the years.
                  From the perspective of Edward Tufte’s concept of information resolution, this graphic falls somewhere in the middle of
                   that spectrum because although the graphic may look dense with information, it actually lacks depth and context in order
                    to be more simplistic and visually appealing. 
</p>
<p> As I just alluded to, this graphic does a good job at getting a broad point across by displaying a variety of quantitative
                 measures using a different display for each category. The images are easy to look at, read, and understand. This cleanliness
                  and simplicity allows readers to quickly understand the message just by taking a glance for a few seconds. That is even what
                   drew me into this graphic in the first place. However, readability and simplicity are not all that matter. Tufte specifically
                    emphasizes that high-quality graphics should not just be readable, but also have fine-grained detail, variability, and 
                    explanatory context, and that is what this graphic lacks in terms of information resolution.
</p>

            <h3>Cherry Picking</h3>
            <p> One of the biggest details that immediately jumped out at me were the different start and end dates on each of the graphics. 
                No two of them were the same, and there is no shown reason behind why certain dates were chosen. After reading and thinking
                 more into why this might be, cherry-picking came to mind. It is very possible that the dates for each graphic were chosen
                  to maximize visible improvement in those categories. Also, while each of these trends does support the positive narrative 
                  that things are getting better in the world, what about areas that are not and might contradict this optimistic idea? 
                  These could be things such as inequality, political instability, etc. I believe that by not including some of these
                   things, this graphic supports the narrative that everything is getting better in the world, when unfortunately that
                    is not always the case.


            <h3>Effects Without Causes</h3>
            <p>The next concern I looked into was effects without causes. This graphic clearly demonstrates that life expectancy, 
                investment in renewable energy, health spending, people living in a democracy, literacy, and electricity access are all improving,
                 but fails to say why. Readers may be curious about the information behind the growth such as new policies, technology improvement,
                  and more, but are left with nothing here. From Tufte’s perspective, this limits the explanatory power of the graphic due to 
                  the separation of effects from causes. Overall, the reader is pushed to accept the information as they see it without knowing why
                 or how the increases happened. 
</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>In conclusion, I really do not think this is a “bad” graphic, it just has a little bit of room for improvement and clarity.
                 At the end of the day, graphics like these are important to remind people that there are some things going good and 
                 improving in the world. As an optimist myself, it’s hopeful to see these kinds of things and remember that there is always
                  a bright side to look at.
